## STEP 1 --> create a class containing relevant variables and functions
class DartboardSimulator:
    ## class attributes (length and radius because board is not changing)

    ## initialize the object, using default values for iterations (50) and throws (10)
    def __init__(self, length=2, radius=1, iterations=50, throws_per_iteration=10):
        self.length = length
        self.radius = radius
        self.iterations = iterations
        self.throws_per_iteration = throws_per_iteration
        self.results_df = None
        
    ## STEP 2 --> simulate dart throws
    ## dartThrow takes no input, outputs two floats: 
        # x- and y-coordinates for where a random dart landed in a square 2x2 centered at (0,0)
    ## assumes the dart lands inside the square

        ## randomly generate an x- and y-coordinate between -1 and 1
    def dart_throw(self):
        x = np.random.uniform(-1, 1)
        y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1)
        return x, y
    
    ## STEP 3 --> determine if throws are inside the circle
    
    ## inCircle takes x and y coordinate input, outputs boolean value for "in circle" 
        # determining if dart throw is in a circle (rad 1) centered at (0,0) in the square
    def dart_check(self, x, y):
        distance = x**2 + y**2
        return distance <= 1
        ## using formula from: 
        # R^2 = x^2 + y^2
    
    ## STEP 4 --> simulate a number of throws and save results
    
    ## output is a double nested dictionary. outside keys are number of iterations, within each iteration, 
        # keys are the number of throws. the value of the innermost dictionaries is a dictionary of info
        # about each throw, including the x and y coordinate, and whether it made it in the circle
    ## input is a number of iterations and a number of throws (default values from initializing)
    def simulation(self):
        ## create an empty dataframe to return at the end
        results_df = pd.DataFrame()
        ## loop through iterations based on iteration input
        for i in range(self.iterations):
            ## for each iteration, create a dictionary to be added to the results at the end
            iteration_result = {}
            ## within the iteration, "throw" the dart a certain number of times
            for throws in range(self.throws_per_iteration):    
                ## within each throw: 
                ## "throw" the dart and record if it made it in the circle
                x, y = self.dart_throw()                
                ## add to countervariable if dart "inside" circle
                inside = self.dart_check(x, y)
                ## store the dart inforamtion in a dictionary (x and y coords, and if it made it in)
                throw_result = {"coordinate": [x, y], "inside": inside}
                ## add the "throw" dictionary to iteration dictionary, key = throw number
                iteration_result.update({throws: throw_result})
            ## after all throws, append the iteration dictionary to results dataframe
            results_df = results_df.append(iteration_result, ignore_index=True)
            self.results_df = results_df
        ## after all iterations are over, return the results
        return results_df
   
    ## STEP 5 --> math )): estimate pi (like a loser who doesn't know 3.14...) using circle and side lengths
        
        ## go through each iteration of the dataframe

            
            ## count the number of throws
   
            
            ## count the number of times the throw 'landed on the board"
            
            
            ## pi value = ins/throws * 4
            
            
            ## calculate error (distance of pi from actual pi value)
            
            
            ## append the individual pi and error values to their lists


            
    ## STEP 7 --> calculates the standard error of the pi estimates and returns them

        

    
    ## STEP 6 --> create a visualization of a dartboard after all the throws have landed
    
    ## creates a single dartboard using one simulation as input

        
        ## plot a matplotlib figure

        
        ## set the x and y range of the coordinate plane using .set()

        
        ## move the axes so they are centered using .spines().[location].set_position()


        
        ## remove the top and right lines for visualz


        
        ## add the circle to the middle of the plane


        
        ## remove ins from iteration using try to only run it once  

        

        
        
        ## loop through the iteration

            
            ## access the x and y value for each throw
            
            
            ## plot each point using .scatter()

            

    
    ## to plot several simulations on top of each other: 

        
        ## loop through the output of simulation

            
            ## access each simulation and provide it as input to visualization
